"""The filesystem as the model holds it, read from its state, and what the circuit is doing.

`read` decodes the DeltaNet tables of a cache (nothing is kept on the side): the file count, each
file's version and path from the version and path tables (layer 4), and every link from the link
bits (layer 6). Rows are dual-rail, so a bit is whichever of its two rails is set.

`Monitor` follows the token stream and lights the circuit's layers: the call parser while Qwen
writes a call, the lookup and the tables at a call's end, the path printer, the link bits and the
copy head as the response comes out.
